# water-monitoring-system-gcp
The scope of this project is to design, build and implement an end-to-end low-cost water monitoring system using cloud computing and IoT to capture data such as water level, quality parameters such as pH value, temperature, TDS, etc. and perform data analytics on the collected raw data using following Google cloud services: Cloud IoT Core for device connection and management, Cloud Pub/Sub for data ingestion, Cloud Functions for building backend service, Cloud Storage for storing the data, Cloud Dataflow for streaming and analytics, BigQuery for querying the data, Data Studio for visualizing the data, IoT Device Simulator for mimicking physical hardware sensors by sending data directly to the cloud at regular intervals.
